# Simple R Markdown Notebook

This is a very simple template for a data analysis notebook created using the excellent [R Markdown package](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). See the [notebook created from this repository](https://lmullen.github.io/rmd-notebook/) to see what it does. It doesn't do much, because it's simple. Or see [one of my notebooks for a research project](http://lmullen.github.io/civil-procedure-codes/).
